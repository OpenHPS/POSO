## Use Cases

With POSO, we aim to provide a generic positioning system ontology that can support a wide variety of use cases.
Since positioning systems are constantly evolving, we welcome any use cases that are currently not yet supported by
creating a "use case" issue.

## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a 
   build. The included .gitignore should make sure that this is the case.
2. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface, this includes new environment 
   variables, exposed ports, useful file locations and container parameters.
3. Increase the version numbers in any examples files and the README.md to the new version that this
   Pull Request would represent. The versioning scheme we use is [SemVer](http://semver.org/).
4. You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of two other developers, or if you 
   do not have permission to do that, you may request the second reviewer to merge it for you.
