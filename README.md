# POSO: A Generic Positioning System Ontology
*POSO is a generic ontology positioning system ontology. Other than many geospatial ontologies, POSO focuses on the semantics needed to express a positioning system, their techiques and the location data along with other information it can output.*

## Classes

### System
![](docs/images/systems_and_procedures.svg)

#### `poso:PositioningSystem`
A positioning system is a **deployed** sytem that can obtain a position.

#### `poso:LocationBasedService`
A location-based service is a black box interface for a positioning system.

### Feature Of Interest
POSO extends the concepts of `sosa:FeatureOfInterest` with more specific features.

#### `poso:TrackedFeature`
A tracked feature is a tracked object, entity or feature. It is a spatial object with at least one `poso:hasPosition` property.

### Stimulus
A positioning system can be triggered by movement. We identify linear (i.e. `poso:LinearMovement`) and angular movement (i.e. `poso:AngularMovement`) as two possible events that can
cause an update of the output position. An application that shows the position of a person on a map might only be interested in linear movement while a navigation application requires real-time orientation updates.

### Procedure
> A workflow, protocol, plan, algorithm, or computational method specifying how to make an Observation, create a Sample, or make a change to the state of the world (via an Actuator). A Procedure is re-usable, and might be involved in many Observations, Samplings, or Actuations. It explains the steps to be carried out to arrive at reproducible Results.

In the context of a positioning system, a procedure is an algorithm or computational method to sample sensor data to a position. POSO offers general classes for the different positioning techniques, and individuals for well known positioning algorithms in the `poso-common` module.

### Observable Properties
> An observable quality (property, characteristic) of a FeatureOfInterest.

POSO aims to observe the position, orientation and related properties needed in a positioning system. Classes are available for a position (i.e. absolute or relative), orientation and velocity.

## Properties

### `poso:hasPosition`, `poso:hasOrientation`, `poso:hasVelocity`, `poso:hasAcceleration`
Sub properties of `ssn:hasProperty`, the properties indicate a specific type of property. Link traversal query processors could utilise these semantics to skip link traversal to datasets of irrelevant properties.

### `poso:madeBySystem`
SOSA and SSN offer properties for linking an Observation to a procedure that is implemented by a system. One single procedure
can be implemented by multiple systems. In order to have a deterministic link between the observation and the system that observed it, we use `poso:madeBySystem`.

### `poso:isRelativeTo`
In order to indicate a relative position relative to another feature of interest, the `poso:isRelativeTo` property can be used. In combination with the existing `ssn:isPropertyOf` property, this can indicate a relative position of a feature of interest, relative to another feature of interest.

## Individuals

### Positioning Systems
A positioning system is an established system for obtaining a position. Existing satelite systems such as GPS and GLONASS exist that can be used. `poso-common` already provides these systems as existing individuals.
