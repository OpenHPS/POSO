# POSO: A Generic Positioning System Ontology
*POSO is a generic ontology positioning system ontology. Other than many geospatial ontologies, POSO focuses on 
the semantics needed to express a position.*

## Classes

### Stimulus
A positioning system can be triggered by movement. We identify linear and angular movement as two possible events that can
cause an update of the output position.

### Procedure
> A workflow, protocol, plan, algorithm, or computational method specifying how to make an Observation, create a Sample, or make a change to the state of the world (via an Actuator). A Procedure is re-usable, and might be involved in many Observations, Samplings, or Actuations. It explains the steps to be carried out to arrive at reproducible Results.

In the context of a positioning system, a procedure is an algorithm or computational method to sample sensor data to a position. POSO offers general classes for the different positioning techniques, and individuals for well known positioning algorithms in the `poso-common` module.

### Observable Properties
> An observable quality (property, characteristic) of a FeatureOfInterest.

POSO aims to observe the position, orientation and related properties needed in a positioning system. Classes are available for a position (i.e. absolute or relative), orientation and velocity.

## Properties

## Individuals

### Positioning Systems
A positioning system is an established system for obtaining a position. Existing satelite systems such as GPS and GLONASS exist that can be used. `poso-common` already provides these systems as existing individuals.
